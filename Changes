Revision history for Perl extension Class::Factory.

0.02  Wed Jan 30 00:22:58 EST 2002

      Added simple constructor to be inherited as needed. This
      constructor automatically calls 'init()', not coincidentally the
      name that Class::Base uses. Small variable name changes.

      Original version with tests, documentation and everything,
      written after the third or fourth time I cut-and-pasted a
      'add_type()' method to implement a dynamic factory class :-)
