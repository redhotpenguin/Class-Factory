Revision history for Perl extension Class::Factory.

0.03  Sun Feb 10 13:00:20 EST 2002

      Added the ability to register a type/class without having
      Class::Factory include it. This is useful for modules that want
      to know all of their types at startup time but don't want to
      bring in a particular class until that type is requested. (See
      POD for details.)

0.02  Wed Jan 30 00:22:58 EST 2002

      Added simple constructor to be inherited as needed. This
      constructor automatically calls 'init()', not coincidentally the
      name that Class::Base uses. Small variable name changes.

      Original version with tests, documentation and everything,
      written after the third or fourth time I cut-and-pasted a
      'add_type()' method to implement a dynamic factory class :-)
