Class::Factory - Base class for dynamic factory classes
==========================

  package My::Factory;

  use strict;
  use base qw( Class::Factory );

  # Add our default types

  My::Factory->add_factory_type( perl  => 'My::Factory::Perl' );
  My::Factory->add_factory_type( blech => 'My::Factory::Blech' );

  # Register optional types

  My::Factory->register_factory_type( java => 'My::Factory::Java' );

  1;

  # Create new objects using the default types

  my $perl_item = My::Factory->new( 'perl', foo => 'bar' );  
  my $blech_item = My::Factory->new( 'blech', foo => 'baz' );  

  # Create new object using the optional type; this library is loaded
  # on the first use

  my $java_item = My::Factory->new( 'java', foo => 'quux' );

  # Adding a new factory type in code

  My::Factory->add_factory_type( custom => 'Other::Custom::Class' );
  my $custom_object = My::Factory->new( 'custom', this => 'that' );

  # Register a new factory type in code

  My::Factory->register_factory_type( bleededge => 'Other::Customized::Class' );
  my $edgy_object = My::Factory->new( 'bleededge', this => 'that' );
